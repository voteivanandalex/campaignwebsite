        <h1>Vote for the Dream Team!</h1>
        <h2>Ivan Watson for President & Alex Verity for VP</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Why vote for us?</strong> Because your senior year should be legendary, and we promise to make it <em>at least</em> 47% more fun.*</p>
        
        <p>*Percentage may vary. Consult your local mathematician for details.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Our Bold Promises:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shorter lines at the vending machines (probably).</li>
            <li>A senior prank that won't get us expelled.</li>
            <li>More spirit days, because wearing pajamas to school should be a right, not a privilege.</li>
            <li>A prom so good, even the teachers will want to dance.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><em>Add image of Ivan and Alex looking presidential (or at least like they know what theyâ€™re doing).</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>People who have promised to vote:</strong> <span id="voteCount">0</span></p>
        
        <button class="button" onclick="increaseVoteCount()">Promise to vote for us</button>
        
        <p>Paid for by absolutely no one because we're broke high school students.</p>
